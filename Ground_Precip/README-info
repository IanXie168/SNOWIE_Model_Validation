https://data.eol.ucar.edu/dataset/534.011

Summary
This dataset contains the NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) and
Idaho Power Company's (IPC) precipitation gauge data from 12 different sites
during the SNOWIE (Seeded and Natural Orographic Wintertime Clouds: The Idaho
Experiment) project. Data were collected from 7 January 2017 to 16 March 2017.
The data frequency of IPC Geonor gauges is approximately 1/15 minute, and the
frequency of NCAR gauges at Clear Creek and Silver Creek is 1 minute. These
data are in readable ASCII text format. Data have been quality controlled.
Please refer to the readme for more information.
